{"name":"shinyBS","tagline":"Twitter Bootstrap Components for Shiny","body":"### Intro\r\n`shinyBS` is an R package that introduces many of the missing components of Twitter Bootstrap into `shiny`. These include:\r\n* Tooltips\r\n* Popovers\r\n* Alerts\r\n* TypeAheads\r\n* Collapse Panels\r\n* Modal Windows\r\n* Progress Bars\r\n\r\nIn addition to adding additional Twitter Bootstrap components, `shinyBS` also adds table highlighting functions and a menu creation system based on Twitter Bootstrap's navbar component.\r\n\r\n### Installing shinyBS\r\n`shinyBS` has been published on CRAN an so can be installed in the usual way:\r\n\r\n```R\r\ninstall.packages(\"shinyBS\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo get the latest working version you can install from github with `devtools`:\r\n\r\n```R\r\n# To install devtools:\r\ninstall.packages(\"devtools\")\r\n# To install shinyBS from github:\r\ninstall_github(\"ebailey78/shinyBS\")\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Working with shinyBS\r\nI've tried to make functions in `shinyBS` work and look, as much as possible, like native `shiny` functions. Most functions used in `ui.R` are prepended with `bs`. So, for example, you can create a popover from within `ui.R` with:\r\n\r\n```R\r\nbsPopover(id = <target_id>, \r\n          title = \"Popover Title\", \r\n          content = \"This is the content of the popover.\", \r\n          placement = \"below\",\r\n          trigger = \"hover\"\r\n          )\r\n```","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
